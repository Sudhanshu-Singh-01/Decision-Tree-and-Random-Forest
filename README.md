# Decision-Tree-and-Random-Forest

Trying to predict whether or not a person who has taken loan was able to repay back loan amount to bank.

Using loan_data.csv as data we are gonna try to do prediction based on Decision Tree and also by Random Forest Algorithms.

While writing codes we also had used dummy variable concept as one of the columns was not having numeric data but in the form of bunch of categories in string.

By watching both the conclusions of Decision Tree and Random Forest we can clearly say Random Forest performed far better than Decision Tree.
